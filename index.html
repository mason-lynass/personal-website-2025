                <p>I'm currently working as a freelance software engineer and web developer, building websites for
                    clients and learning new skills & languages by developing personal projects. I like to use
                    JavaScript & TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, SQL & PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and Git.</p>
                <p>I've performed original generative electronic music, given recitals of contemporary percussion
                    repertoire, played drums in various pop & rock bands, and performed at festivals and concert halls
                    across the country. I've worked as a sound designer, engineer, and music producer with film
                    production studios, independent artists, podcast productions, and other freelance clients.</p>
                <!-- <p>Mason graduated from the University of Washington with a Master of Music degree in percussion
                    performance. At UW, Mason studied with Dr. Bonnie Whiting, played in the Partch Ensemble and various
                    UW ensembles, and recorded and released a recital of solo percussion repertoire in June of 2020.</p> -->
                <!-- <p>Mason has performed as a soloist and as an ensemble member in venues and concert halls across the
                    country. As a soloist, Mason's work was most recently featured at his Masters recital, at the Racer
                    Sessions, and Seattle's John Cage Musicircus. Outside of his solo work, Mason has played festivals
                    and toured the west coast with Señor Fin and Baby Jessica, performed at the Percussive Arts Society
                    International Convention with the UNT Percussion Ensemble and the Santa Clara Vanguard, and hung
                    outat SoSI, Chosen Vale, and Inuksuit NYC.</p> -->
                <p>My composition <i>Tesserae</i>, composed for
                    percussion trio or quartet, won the Portland Percussion Group's Call for Scores in 2017. Since the
                    Portland Percussion Group premiered Tesserae in May of 2017, the
                    piece has been published through Tapspace and performed by ensembles around the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    I earned a Master of Music degree at the University of Washington and a Bachelor of Music degree at
                    the University of North Texas, studying percussion performance with renowned faculty including
                    Bonnie Whiting, Christopher Deane, Ed Soph, and Paul Rennick. I completed a 15-week Full-Stack
                    Software Engineering bootcamp through the Flatiron School in January 2023.
