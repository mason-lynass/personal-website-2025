I spent a day at Johnny Goss' Dandelion Gold studio to record every small & handheld percussion instrument I own (and a few of Johnny's things too). We recorded more than 60 instruments with a wide variety of microphones. I poured over the audio we recorded to cut one shots and loops, then organized everything into a cohesive, high quality sample pack.

We used an AEA R88 mk2, a WA-251, a U67, and a pair of MXL V67s to record all of these instruments:

Cymbal & Gong:
17" Zildjian K Dark Thin Crash
18" Zildjian Kerope Crash
24" Keplinger stainless steel Cymbal
24" Steve Weiss wind Gong
two pair of finger cymbals

Drums:
Chinese tom
udu
djembe

Handheld:
cabasa
wooden frog
guiro
ratchet
singing bowl (C4)
slapstick
vibraslap

Hit:
almglocken
two pair of claves
a small collection of cowbells
Abel, Sabian, and toy triangles
Woodblocks
gankogui
qraqeb
a three tone bell my mom found at a flea market
Ribbon Crasher

Shake:
so many different shakers
a small family of Altoids tin shakers
two angklung
duck & elephant bells
Indian ankle bells
Flexatone
three sets of goat hooves
two shekere
sleigh bells
thunder tube
wind chimes

Tambourines:
Black Swamp classical tambourine (copper jingles)

            React.js, Ruby on Rails, SQL & PostgreSQL, Sinatra & ActiveRecord,
            HTML, CSS, and Git. I've used these languages and frameworks to

            independently or with collaborators. You can find info and links to projects I've worked on below!</p>
          <p>
            I decided to study software engineering and learn more about
            computer science when I noticed that my creative interests
            became much more computer-based since early 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around that time I started learning about electronic music and
            Ableton Live. My listening adventures inspired me to make
            music in new ways, exploring synthesis, sound design, sampling,
            live looping, scripting, and automation. Once I realized that I was making music by programming a computer,
            I started exploring other things you can do by programming computers, and I got into Software
            Engineering!

          <p>
            To develop a solid technical foundation, I completed a 15-week Software Engineering course at the Flatiron
            School. During my time studying at Flatiron, I studied front-end & back-end web development and I honed
            essential skills and habits to quickly pick up new concepts and ideas. I thrived in the fast-paced &
            rigorous learning environment, and I assisted & communicated
            with my peers in my course to ensure that we all developed a practical
            base of Software Engineering knowledge and
            skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited to use my technical knowledge and skills to pursue full-time work as a Software
            Engineer, to contribute to an exciting and supportive team of
            developers, and to share what I've learned to help others.

        For my final project of my Flatiron SE course, I built a Fantasy Sumo

          I've been meticulously compiling and arranging data about ozumo,
          professional sumo wrestling in Japan, since 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I even considered making a website, I conceived of a set of
          rules and scoring system for my Fantasy Sumo game, and maintained
          multiple leagues at once in a

            Sheet</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my newly acquired knowledge from Flatiron, I used React.js and
          Ruby on Rails to build a website for my game! Users can login or
          create an account, then draft a team of 7 wrestlers to root for in the
          upcoming tournament. User & team information is stored in PSQL
          database - in the future, users will be able to view their previous
          teams and compare how they've fared against other users.
        </p>
        <p>
          My website has a comprehensive database of information, real world &
          game-specific statistics about all of the wrestlers - this database is
          the first I've found that allows users to sort by columns to compare
          wrestler stats.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also made an account page to display scores for a logged-in user's
          team, and Rules & Scoring and Terminology pages to help newcomers
          draft promising teams and learn more about sumo!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the near future, I'll switch to using an API my friend
          <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-r-54a012184/">John</a>
          has
          helped me build, so that I can retrieve wrestler and match information
          which automatically updates instead of updating scores and information
          manually.

        <h3>I made a website for the <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target="_blank"
            href="https://www.woodlandtheater.org">Woodland Theater</a>, a DIY music venue and arts space in Seattle.
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div id="woodlandText">
        <p>As a member of the space, I have a music practice space above the stage, and I volunteer to help put on shows
          and maintain our online presence.</p>
        <p>Woodland Theater has hosted shows & events since 2018, and it has a long history as a space for the arts and
          creative happenings. I wanted to honor the history of the space by writing about its past on the About page,
          and archiving the shows catalogued on the previous website.</p>
        <p>To catalog past & future shows & events, I built a simple API through <a rel='noopener noreferrer'
            target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity Studio</a>. With a little bit of
          TypeScript and some help from their very useful documentation, I defined two data types (shows and bands)
          which are accessible at unique endpoints. Only members at Woodland can clone our private API repo, run Sanity
          Studio locally on their device, and add shows and bands to the dataset. I found Sanity Studio very easy to use
          and build with, and their simple UI makes it easy for non-coders to contribute.</p>
        <p>I also used a couple of other APIs from <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target="_blank"
            href="https://behold.so/">Behold</a> and <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target="_blank"
            href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api//">Mailchimp</a> to add features to the site. With
          Behold, I can
          display a gallery of content pulled from the Woodland Instagram page. With the Mailchimp API and a convenient
          Node package, users can add their email address to our venue mailing list, hosted on Mailchimp.</p>
        <p>I had a lot of fun putting this site together and I learned how to use some helpful APIs and tools in the
          process. I wrote a <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target="_blank"
            href="https://medium.com/@masonlynass/using-sanity-io-behold-and-mailchimp-subscribe-to-build-a-venue-website-for-free-f41f20fdd6e1">blog
            post about Sanity, Behold, and Mailchimp-Subscribe</a> where I talk about all of my work in more detail if
          you're interested. I'm excited to see the content change as we add Instagram
          posts and events to the Sanity API. The venue website had been frozen in time since February 2020 so I am so
          glad to know that we have something useful and current again!</p>

          website for goal horn lovers.</h3>

        <div id="iceHonkyText">
          <p>Ice Honky was developed with React.js, which easily handles constantly changing game data. The site
            requests
            data from an external NHL Scores API at a set interval whenever games are happening - we haven't found an
            API
            that allows WebSocket connections yet. Then we use the consistently refreshing data to display scores and
            game
            information.</p>
          <p>If a team has scored since our last refresh, the site will display a modal that shows the most recent goal
            scored, and sound that team's goal horn. I like to use the site to keep track of game scores while working
            on
            other projects - I can just listen for a goal horn to know when my team has scored!</p>
          <p>We've also set up a page with all of the goal horns, so users can hear any horn whenever they want, and try
            to
            find harmonious (or extremely dissonant) combinations of horns. We're using useSound, a custom React hook,
            to
            trigger audio events, whether they come from user input or a change in the data we receive from the API.</p>
          <p>Ice Honky is a collaboration between myself and <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target="_blank"
              href="https://lexdotcom.com/">Alex Naughton</a>, an
            excellent collaborator, full of fun ideas and ingenious solutions.</p>
