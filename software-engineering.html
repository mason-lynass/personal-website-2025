                <p>I'm currently studying software engineering online at the Flatiron School.</p>

                <p>I decided to study software engineering and learn more about computer science when I noticed that my creative interests became much more computer-based since early 2020.</p>
                <p>Around that time I started learning about electronic music and Ableton Live. My listening adventures inspired me to make music in new ways, exploring synthesis, sound design, sampling, live looping, scripting, and automation.</p>
                <p>I hope to build a solid foundation of general CS knowledge so that I can better communicate and collaborate with others, and continue to explore and experiment.</p>
