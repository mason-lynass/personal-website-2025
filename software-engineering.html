          <p>I'm comfortable working with JavaScript,
            React.js, Ruby on Rails, SQL & PostgreSQL, Sinatra & ActiveRecord,
            HTML, CSS, and Git. I've used these languages and frameworks to
            develop & deploy Full-Stack web applications, working
            independently or with collaborators. You can find info and links to projects I've worked on below!</p>
          <p>
            I decided to study software engineering and learn more about
            computer science when I noticed that my creative interests
            became much more computer-based since early 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around that time I started learning about electronic music and
            Ableton Live. My listening adventures inspired me to make
            music in new ways, exploring synthesis, sound design, sampling,
            live looping, scripting, and automation. Once I realized that I was making music by programming a computer,
            I started exploring other things you can do by programming computers, and I got into Software
            Engineering!
          </p>
          <p>
            To develop a solid technical foundation, I completed a 15-week Software Engineering course at the Flatiron
            School. During my time studying at Flatiron, I studied front-end & back-end web development and I honed
            essential skills and habits to quickly pick up new concepts and ideas. I thrived in the fast-paced &
            rigorous learning environment, and I assisted & communicated
            with my peers in my course to ensure that we all developed a practical
            base of Software Engineering knowledge and
            skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited to use my technical knowledge and skills to pursue full-time work as a Software
            Engineer, to contribute to an exciting and supportive team of
            developers, and to share what I've learned to help others.

          I've been meticulously compiling and arranging data about ozumo,
          professional sumo wrestling in Japan, since 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I even considered making a website, I conceived of a set of
          rules and scoring system for my Fantasy Sumo game, and maintained
          multiple leagues at once in a

        <p>
          With my newly acquired knowledge from Flatiron, I used React.js and
          Ruby on Rails to build a website for my game! Users can login or
          create an account, then draft a team of 7 wrestlers to root for in the
          upcoming tournament. User & team information is stored in PSQL
          database - in the future, users will be able to view their previous
          teams and compare how they've fared against other users.
        </p>
        <p>
          My website has a comprehensive database of information, real world &
          game-specific statistics about all of the wrestlers - this database is
          the first I've found that allows users to sort by columns to compare
          wrestler stats.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also made an account page to display scores for a logged-in user's
          team, and Rules & Scoring and Terminology pages to help newcomers
          draft promising teams and learn more about sumo!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the near future, I'll switch to using an API my friend
          <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-r-54a012184/">John</a> has
          helped me build, so that I can retrieve wrestler and match information
          which automatically updates instead of updating scores and information
          manually.

      <div id="iceHonkyText">
        <p>Ice Honky was developed with React.js, which easily handles constantly changing game data. The site requests
          data from an external NHL Scores API at a set interval whenever games are happening - we haven't found an API
          that allows WebSocket connections yet. Then we use the consistently refreshing data to display scores and game
          information.</p>
        <p>If a team has scored since our last refresh, the site will display a modal that shows the most recent goal
          scored, and sound that team's goal horn. I like to use the site to keep track of game scores while working on
          other projects - I can just listen for a goal horn to know when my team has scored!</p>
        <p>We've also set up a page with all of the goal horns, so users can hear any horn whenever they want, and try
          to
          find harmonious (or extremely dissonant) combinations of horns. We're using useSound, a custom React hook, to
          trigger audio events, whether they come from user input or a change in the data we receive from the API.</p>
        <p>Ice Honky is a collaboration between myself and <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target="_blank" href="https://lexdotcom.com/">Alex Naughton</a>, an
          excellent collaborator, full of fun ideas and ingenious solutions.</p>

          My buddy <a target="_blank" rel='noopener noreferrer' href="https://lexdotcom.com/">Alex</a> and I worked
          together to build Better Bathroom Bureau - a website dedicated to
          helping people in Seattle access bathroom facilities around the city.
          We used React.js with some custom CSS to give it a "Craigslist-y"
          look on the frontend, and Rails to handle the backend and store all of our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Better Bathroom Bureau began as a Tumblr blog I started right after I
          moved to Seattle in 2015 - I reviewed bathrooms I visited out of 10,
          detailing highlights or lowlights in bathroom function, cleanliness,
          and style.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a great time working with Alex to create a full-fledged website
          version of BBB, and I'm excited to open up the bathroom discussion to
          other contributors and users around Seattle. This is the kind of
          resource that works best with a lot of user input!
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can view bathrooms stored in the BBB database and leave reviews
          on bathrooms as a guest. Users can also login / create an account to
          contribute new bathrooms to the database, leave reviews tied to their
          account, and save favorite bathrooms for future reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each bathroom submitted by users has its own page, with information
          about its description and accessibility, its location on a Google Map
          (thanks Google Maps API!), and reviews that site users have left about
          their experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the near future, we'll deploy the site and add a feature that shows
          "Bathrooms Near Me," cutting out some search time for users in a more
          urgent need of facilities. We hope that people around Seattle will
          contribute and the community will benefit from our hard work and
          creativity!

          <p>In my React.js portfolio projects, I prefer to use useSound to play audio because of its simpler syntax and
            extremely accessible documentation. I like to use the hook to play audio inside event handlers, on form
            submissions, and wherever I think my site could use a little more character.</p>
          <p>For this talk at the monthly SeattleJS meetup, I introduced the basic capabilities of useSound, then showed
            off some fun mini projects I made with it. I built a Random Note Generator to recreate the generative music
            I make in Ableton Live, as well as a keyboard-accessible drum machine and a very simple audio player.</p>

            <a href="https://www.binkbeats.com/binklooper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">binkLooper</a>
            in Ableton Live.
          </h2>
          <ul>
            In order to identify, realize, and perform a complete piece of music
            without any pre-recorded MIDI pitch/rhythm data or pre-recorded
            audio stems, I developed a multi-step process:
            <li>
              I analyze the work to determine if the arrangement of musical
              phrases and song structure could reasonably be performed through
              looping. Musical phrases which repeat with some regularity, songs
              with similar chord structures throughout, and a lack of
              non-repeating elements occurring simultaneously are all good signs
              of a song you could loop.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once I think a song could be fit to loop, I'll map out the song
              structure, orchestration in each section, and specific rhythms and
              pitches in each musical element. It's just another method of
              transcription!
            </li>
            <li>
              Some detailed planning is required to turn a transcription into a
              programmable structure in Ableton Live. I need to decide when (in
              musical time) I'll record each element, making sure that I stick
              to my own physical limitations, and make sure to leave space for
              non-repeating elements or other things I need to perform in
              real-time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now that I have my performance structure in mind, I program dummy
              clips and automation in the binkLooper and other devices in
              Ableton Live. I can prescribe when instruments are recorded, when
              they begin looping, when they start and stop again, and how
              effects process the recorded MIDI data, and assign all of these
              functions to a specific, predictable timing.
            </li>
            <li>
              With a little troubleshooting and practice, I can perform actions
              on MIDI devices or with physical instruments, which are recorded
              and played back in my prescribed framework, in order to perform
              complex arrangements of many musical elements independently (with
              help from my computer, of course)!

              Music</a>
            and other slow ambient music, and I made a sort of primitive piece

            swell and fade in volume at their own pace.

            I had already started to make procedural generative music in Ableton
