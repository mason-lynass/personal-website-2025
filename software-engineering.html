                    <p>I decided to study software engineering and learn more about computer science<br>when I noticed that my creative interests became much more computer-based since early 2020.</p>
                    <p>Around that time I started learning about electronic music and Ableton Live.<br>My listening adventures inspired me to make music in new ways, exploring synthesis, sound design, sampling, live looping, scripting, and automation.</p>
                    <p>I hope to build a solid foundation of general CS knowledge so that I can better communicate and collaborate with others, and continue to explore and experiment.</p>

                <h2 class="biggerText">I taught myself to live loop songs and different pieces of music,<br>using BinkBeats' <a href="https://www.binkbeats.com/binklooper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">binkLooper</a>  in Ableton Live.</h2>
                <ul>In order to identify, realize, and perform a complete piece of music without any pre-recorded MIDI pitch/rhythm data or pre-recorded audio stems, I developed a multi-step process:
                    <li>I analyze the work to determine if the arrangement of musical phrases and song structure could reasonably be performed through looping. Musical phrases which repeat with some regularity, songs with similar chord structures throughout, and a lack of non-repeating elements occurring simultaneously are all good signs of a song you could loop.</li>
                    <li>Once I think a song could be fit to loop, I'll map out the song structure, orchestration in each section, and specific rhythms and pitches in each musical element. It's just another method of transcription!</li>
                    <li>Some detailed planning is required to turn a transcription into a programmable structure in Ableton Live. I need to decide when (in musical time) I'll record each element, making sure that I stick to my own physical limitations, and make sure to leave space for non-repeating elements or other things I need to perform in real-time.</li>
                    <li>Now that I have my performance structure in mind, I program dummy clips and automation in the binkLooper and other devices in Ableton Live. I can prescribe when instruments are recorded, when they begin looping, when they start and stop again, and how effects process the recorded MIDI data, and assign all of these functions to a specific, predictable timing.</li>
                    <li>With a little troubleshooting and practice, I can perform actions on MIDI devices or with physical instruments, which are recorded and played back in my prescribed framework, in order to perform complex arrangements of many musical elements independently (with help from my computer, of course)!</li>

                <p>This was one of my first experiments in Unreal Engine's Metasounds;<br>I don't know much about Metasounds yet, but it seems like an exciting and inspiring tool for creative audio projects.</p>
                <p>I was thinking of Brian Eno's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLZtnadL1s0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Discreet Music</a> and other slow ambient music, and I made a sort of primitive piece of music in which four wave generators produce random pitches that swell and fade in volume at their own pace.</p>
                <p>I had already started to make procedural generative music in Ableton Live,and it was a puzzle to switch to a different user interface and reconfigure the rules in a new environment.</p>
                <p>I would love to work on video games, installations, or any other projects that develop in Unreal Engine!</p>

                <p>I conceived of a set of rules and scoring system for a Fantasy Sumo game, maintaining multiple leagues at once.</p>
                <p>I have a separate page for historical Fantasy Sumo scores going back to 2000, and another page that I use to track winning techniques during each tournament.</p>
                <p>I also track win/loss records, extra honors, salaries, wrestler information, and more on an info sheet.</p>
