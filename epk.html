          "His music has a sense of gentle awe and wonder at the things all
          around us as it parps its way along. It's a stroll in the park with
          the pots and pans of human activity." -

      <p>
        Mason Lynass is an electronic musician making generative, ambient, and
        IDM music in Seattle. His recent generative electronic music works
        explore themes of quantum listening, personal introspection, and human
        connection to nature and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        He released a full-length album, “Music for an Ordinary Day,” in May
        2022, and consistently releases new singles, EPs, and music videos.
        Mason has performed original generative electronic music as a soloist
        around Seattle and hopes to expand his reach in 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an artist, Mason strives to build connections through musical
        improvisation and collaboration, to engage with the relentless modern
        world from a critical and empathic perspective, and to encourage
        listeners to allow time for introspection by providing opportunities
        to engage actively or passively with music.
