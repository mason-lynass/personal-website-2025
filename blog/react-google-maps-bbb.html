          Using React-Google-Maps, AdvancedMarkers, and implementing Google Maps
          JavaScript API features in the Better Bathroom Bureau website
        </h1>
        <h4>July 1, 2024</h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        To provide an ideal user experience on the Better Bathroom Bureau web
        platform, I've used Google Maps and its various APIs to display maps and
        markers, geolocate users and facilities, and allow users to search for
        restrooms closest to their location or address. I recently noticed that
        the google.maps.Marker component I've been using to display markers has
        been deprecated by the Google Maps team. Since I needed to update the
        marker component in various places in the site, I took the opportunity
        to re-evaluate how I implement the Google Maps features across the
        board. I'll use this post to show my initial implementation, some
        JavaScript packages and React libraries you can use to add Google Maps
        features to a web app, and describe my current solution with some brand
        new site features.
      </p>
      <img src="" />
      <p>
        It's a good idea to update your google.maps.Marker components to use the
        AdvancedMarkerElement class instead, even if it's not the most
        site-breaking change. AdvancedMarkers can easily accommodate collision
        and visibility preferences, style customization, and creating markers
        with graphics. If you've struggled to customize Marker elements in the
        past, this solution will save you a bunch of time and effort. Check out
        the official documentation from Google about migrating to
        AdvancedMarkers, and while you're at it, make sure your website isn't
        using any previously provided samples that might be using a polyfill.io
        script!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first “finished” version of the BBB site, I tried multiple
        different libraries and helpers to add a map with a marker to various
        pages, including the js-api-loader NPM package from Google Maps, but I
        was hoping to find something React-specific, and decided to use the
        react-wrapper package instead. The react-wrapper package uses the
        js-api-loader package to load the Google Maps JavaScript API, but allows
        for more streamlined implementation and customization of React
        components. Wrap your components in the "Wrapper" component and add your
        API Key as a prop to load the API and use its features in React syntax.
        Here's an example of a map from a single bathroom page:
      </p>
      <code></code>
      <p>with a BathroomPageMap component that looks like this:</p>
      <code></code>
      <p>and a Marker component like this:</p>
      <code></code>
      <p>
        Large sections of the code for this BathroomPageMap and Marker were
        pulled directly from the documentation for the Google Maps JavaScript
        API. I've added some code related to opening the infoWindow in the
        Marker's onClick event, but otherwise changed very little to get a basic
        map on the page. I specified a “center” and “zoom” for the
        BathroomPageMap, and a “position” for the Marker, as props inside the
        renderMap function.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you follow along with the “Migrate to advanced markers” documentation
        I linked to earlier, you would think that it would be as simple as
        changing google.maps.Marker to google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement
        and adding a Map ID to the map initialization. But I was using
        react-wrapper, which is community-maintained and hasn't seen any
        significant updates in a couple years, so when I tried these changes,
        the “Marker” library would not load correctly, and I couldn't access an
        AdvancedMarkerElement. While react-wrapper was an easy solution for my
        initially simple implementation, I knew that if I wanted to add any
        advanced features to my application, I should probably find a new
        solution for integrating with the Google Maps JavaScript API.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Fortunately for React developers, there's recent official documentation
        on the Google Maps JavaScript API platform detailing how to Add a Google
        Map to a React app — no need to search for independent packages for most
        use cases. Their documentation directs us to use the
        “@vis.gl/react-google-map” package, a third-party library that
        implements most of the key functionality and features from the Google
        Maps Platform. They provide an example codelab and walk-through to
        describe how to use various features, but you can probably modify your
        old codebase without going through the whole example. This package uses
        an "APIProvider" component that uses an API Key prop, similar to the
        react-wrapper package I was previously using, so these initial changes
        were pretty simple to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before modifying any specific components, I wrapped my whole application
        in the "APIProvider" component so that every component that uses the API
        has access to the API with my API Key without explicitly wrapping each
        component separately. This was a quick and easy solution to modify many
        features at once… is it bad to wrap the whole app in this APIProvider
        for any reason? Let me know in the comments, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        After modifying my code to use the new package, here's my new version of
        the Map component from my single bathroom page:
      </p>
      <code></code>
      <p>
        There are a few things to note about this new map component. First of
        all, I'm using default components provided through the react-google-maps
        package instead of my “custom” components I was previously using — the
        default components already allow for plenty of customization that I was
        previously configuring independently. I provided a map ID as a prop to
        the component, and set reuseMaps to “true” so that if a page containing
        a map reloads, the app reuses the previously loaded map instead of
        making another request to the API. I'm also using the “default” center &
        zoom props, instead of just “center” and “zoom”, with “gestureHandling:
        ‘greedy'” in the options config, so that users can move the map with a
        mouse or one finger drag instead of being confined to a fixed position
        and zoom.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        As more users interacted with the BBB site and brainstormed new ideas
        for app features, I ran into a challenge in my more complicated Map
        component on my “Near Me” page, which shows a big map of all of the
        restrooms in the database. Before I adopted the new react-google-maps
        package, the map was already draggable and zoomable. I wanted to be able
        to re-center and reset the zoom of the map based on two events:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. User inputs their street address -> map re-centers to their
          location and zooms in to a more specific region
        </li>
        <li>
          2. User allows the application to access their location through the
          Geolocation API built into most browsers -> once geolocated, map
          re-centers to their location and zooms in to a more specific region
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But using the “default” center and zoom props would not allow me to
        change the camera of the map based on user-provided data, because the
        map would re-render after it receives new data but use the “default”
        props instead of the new data. And simply using “zoom” and “center”
        props would not accommodate any event-based map modulation, in the form
        of inputting an address, allowing geolocation, or manually adjusting the
        camera of the map; the map would always be set to the initial values of
        these props unless they could somehow be modified. This is a use case
        for the “onCenterChanged” and “onZoomChanged” React props listed in the
        documentation for the "Map" component in the API docs.
      </p>
      <p>Here's my code for my new Map component on the Near-Me page:</p>
      <code></code>
      <p>
        With this initialization of the map with specific props and event
        handlers, I can use state variables and their updater functions to
        setMapCenter to a new center provided by a successful geolocation
        request or an approval to use the user's location, as well as updating
        the zoom with setZoom to zoom into a more specific location. With the
        onCenterChanged event handler, when the user manually moves the map, the
        “center” state variable is updated to the new center of the map based on
        the user's click and drag adjustments — the same logic applies to the
        onZoomChanged function.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I don't love about this current setup is that when the map's
        camera is adjusted by a user's address input or location usage approval,
        I think there's some unnecessary computing going on. When either of
        these events occur, the center and zoom are updated, and I believe that
        these updates trigger the onCenterChanged and onZoomChanged functions
        when they don't need to be triggered. Fortunately, this would only cause
        these functions to run one extra time and not trigger an unbreakable
        loop, but I have noticed a slight lag in performance because of this
        small bug. If anyone has any solutions, I'd love to hear some ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the map is displayed on the page and behaving correctly when
        controlled by various user inputs, we can talk about adding markers to
        the map. I've added a marker for every bathroom in the database on this
        page, and the code I wrote to handle that looks like this:
      </p>
      <code></code>
      <p>
        The allBathrooms function is called inside the Map component to include
        all of the rendered pins in the Map. This function uses the “bathrooms”
        array of objects and returns a pin for each object. Each object in the
        array gets a “position” variable using lat & lng K/V pairs stored in the
        object, which is passed to the AdvancedMarker component as a prop along
        with a key, all of the data about the specific bathroom, and an onClick
        event handler. The onClick event handler calls the setClickedPin
        function with the bathroom object as an argument — this function simply
        displays a small information box about the clicked pin, with a link to
        visit the bathroom page about that specific bathroom to view more
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pins are styled with different colors depending on whether the bathroom
        was submitted by the logged-in user; ideally it's an easy way to find
        bathrooms the user has submitted on the map. Feel free to style the pins
        with these component-specific props, or use classNames and ids
        accessible to a separate CSS file.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've enjoyed exploring the capabilities of the Google Maps JavaScript
        API to try to implement my own ideas for features and draw inspiration
        from classes and methods listed in the API docs. I've also used the
        Geocoding API to get location data about addresses provided by users in
        various places on the website — to get lat/lng coordinates for an
        address before storing the information in the database, and also to
        provide a new lat/lng coordinates for the map center based on the user's
        address. Feel free to explore the BBB repo to see how I make requests to
        the Geocoding API and use the response returned from these requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        One big reason I loved using the new vis.gl/react-google-maps package is
        that there are plenty of examples in their documentation! Whether you
        want to specify custom marker clustering, implement autocomplete or add
        directions, display synchronized maps, or just set up a basic example
        map, there are visual examples with code provided on their website. I
        hope this post can help you use the react-google-maps package to add new
        Google Maps or update old maps to your apps and projects!
